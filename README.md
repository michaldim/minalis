# Project Mina Lis

This project was made for my dear grandmother. It tells her life story, and shows her family tree, a photo gallery and her beloved music. Technically, this project was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It features animations, smooth transitions, JavaScript libraries (jQuery, YouTube APIs, Fancybox), and responsive designed CSS adjusted to desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile.
